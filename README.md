Easygrep Keymapping
====================

```
<Leader>vv  - Grep for the word under the cursor, match all occurences,
              like |gstar|
<Leader>vV  - Grep for the word under the cursor, match whole word, like
              |star|
<Leader>va  - Like vv, but add to existing list
<Leader>vA  - Like vV, but add to existing list
<Leader>vr  - Perform a global search on the word under the cursor
              and prompt for a pattern with which to replace it.
<Leader>vo  - Select the files to search in and set grep options
<Leader>vy* - Invoke any option from the options explorer, where * is the
              shortcut for that option.
              e.g. <Leader>vyr - toggles recursion
                   <Leader>vyb - sets buffer grepping mode
                   etc.
```
